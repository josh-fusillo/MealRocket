  make the most of what you already have at home. 
  </p>
  <h3>Popular Ingredients</h3>
  <p>After a full summer of farmers' market finds, a freezer full of meat might have you scratching your head, but with a few key ingredients 
    you can whip up smothered pork chops or honey-mustard slow cooker chicken wings. Rosemary abounds year-round in some 
    states -- baked in shortbread or sprinkled on pita chips brightens snacktime. Too many bottles of ketchup to count? 
    Turn them into a tangy barbecue sauce to brush on chicken thighs with a side of mac and cheese for a simple weeknight dinner. 
    Tomato paste and potatoes can be transformed into patatas bravas for a Spanish spin on a common side dish. 
    What you have will be what you want with Meal Rocket's help.</p>
  <h3>Trending Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Gouda is good as a grilled cheese, but blue cheese and bacon turn french fries into an American version of 
      Canada's poutine. Didn't use all that rye flour for your sourdough starter? Try using ginger to turn it into Christmas cookies. 
      Over your green tea habit? Mandarin orange flavors complement it nicely for a smoothie or a scone. 
      Eyes bigger than your appetite for hard cheese? Stir grated romano or asiago into an epic fondue for crusty bread.</p> 
  <h3>Quick & Easy</h3>
  <p>Avocado oil and chives on hand? Sounds like salad dressing waiting to happen! Whisk in vinegar and a few red pepper flakes 
    and you have a topper for your kale salad. Too many chili peppers and an excess of ground turkey mean a lean and mean meal of chili. Pot roast leftovers are overwhelming, but it can morph into beef pot pie for English meal or a hearty ragu for an Italian dinner. If impulsive grocery shopping yielded a surplus of salmon, you can find the best match for healthy fish recipes right here. 
  Turn cabbage into kimchi or make peanut butter into a Thai dipping sauce for chicken skewers -- whatever ingredients are on your list, 
  there are thousands of recipes to discover on Meal Rocket.
